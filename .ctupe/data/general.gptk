#LEFT and RIGHT
#    Seek backward/forward 5 seconds. Shift+arrow does a 1 second exact seek (see --hr-seek).
#UP and DOWN
#    Seek forward/backward 1 minute. Shift+arrow does a 5 second exact seek (see --hr-seek).
#Ctrl+LEFT and Ctrl+RIGHT
#    Seek to the previous/next subtitle. Subject to some restrictions and might not always work; see sub-seek command.
#Ctrl+Shift+LEFT and Ctrl+Shift+RIGHT

#Shift+Ctrl+BACKSPACE
#    Mark the current position. This will then be used by Shift+BACKSPACE as revert position (once you seek back, the marker will be reset). You can use this to seek around in the file and then return to the exact position where you left off.
